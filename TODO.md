## TODO
- column finders queries
  - ~~create extractors and column finders in 1 step~~
  - ~~rewrite .as(caseClassConstructor) to .as[CaseClassType] to avoid people breaking ColumnFinder~~
- CRUD - primary key on table?
  - ensure we can use withPrimaryKey on update/delete without writing .where(...) first
    (i.e. update(table).set(...).withOptimisicLocking(...))
- security in tables? - subject to uncommenting the real versions of `fetchAll` and `fetchOne` in `SecureExecutorSyntax.scala`
- remove slick and collapse `dal.sqlest` and `dal.common` into `dal`
- optimistic locking
  - fix update/delete DSL so we can use withOptimisticLocking without writing .where(...) first
    (i.e. update(table).set(...).withOptimisicLocking(...))
- CASE operator
- complex custom field types (CashValue)
- improved extractor syntax for creating values from optional columns. The value should be optional if any of the columns are optional but the case class value is non-optional - see orderExtractor for an example use case
- Consider making sqlest [reactive](https://github.com/davidmoten/rxjava-jdbc)
- ConvertedTableColumns
    - Boolean values are often stored in the database with 'Y' as true and '' or 'N' as false. Comparisons must somehow take this into account!!
    - ~~if a ConvertedTableColumn is compared to a literal value the literal value must also be converted~~
    - ~~if a ConvertedTableColumn is compared to another ConvertedTableColumn with different DatabaseType then should this fail to compile?~~
    - ~~I had to make BaseType a non-sealed trait to enable BaseType[Direction] to be defined. This needs to be thought about~~
- ~~IN operator~~
- ~~one to many extractors - implement this for case class with lists in them~~
- ~~BETWEEN operator~~
- ~~remove extractColumn or merge it into extract somehow~~
- ~~Database should maybe handle sessions / transactions~~
- ~~extractList is repeated everywhere. Should this be changed so there is extractHeadOption too?~~
- ~~top-level syntax to run a query and feed the results into an extractor~~
- ~~table functions~~
- ~~option extractors~~
- ~~column conversions~~
- ~~simple custom field types (Email, Url)~~
- ~~insert, update, delete~~
- ~~allow definition of custom functions (separate out operators from functions)~~
- ~~improve hierarchy of Column and Extractors, especially in regard to SimpleAliasedColumn and ConvertedTableColumn~~
